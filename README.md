# Hi, I'm Levi
Started off with Mindstorms at 10, now doing this software thingy properly. Living in Zürich, Switzerland.

Owner of [Acryps AG](https://acryps.com) where we do some cool projects and lots of open source.

I *really* like trains, currently building a 70m² fully automatic model railway layout. All the hardware is released open-source as [EtherRail](https://github.com/etherrail), while the software - built to run on real railways - is distributed for free as [PackTrack](https://github.com/pack-track).

I'm not the biggest fan of bloated web apps or people taking my data.
